      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
        The concept of Imperial Manila reflects the stark differences between the capital region and the rest of the Philippines.
        This highlights the pressing issue of urban vs rural inequality. In line with Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10),
        which aims to reduce inequality within and among countries, our project investigates the income disparity between urban and rural areas in the Philippines.
      </p>
      <h1>Objectives</h1>
      <ol>
        <li> To investigate the income disparity between urban and rural areas in the Philippines </li>
        <li> To investigate the trends/relationships between income inequality and economic stability </li>

          <p>
            Is there a significant difference in average household income between urban and rural areas in the Philippines?

        <div class="callout">
          Null Hypothesis <br>
          There is a significant income disparity between urban and rural areas. <br>

          There is no significant income disparity between urban and rural areas

        <div class="callout">
          Given the CPI, does it affect the income disparity between urban and rural areas.

          Null Hypothesis <br>
          There is insignificant difference in income inequality.<br>

          There is a difference in income inequality given the CPI.

      <h1>Data Collection</h1>
      <p>
        Our dataset can be viewed <a href="https://bit.ly/WFYAutumnDataset">here</a>.
        The datasets were accessed through the CEIC Data Global Database and the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) Database.
        The table below outlines which datasets/variables will be used for each objective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given that the data was obtained from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) rather than collected directly by our team,
        it is important to acknowledge that the PSA has already safeguarded data quality through data cleaning, consistency checks, and error detection.
      </p>
      <p>
        For RQ#1, we extracted data on urbanity and total household income from all editions of the Family Income and Expenditure Survey.

        For RQ#2, ___.

      <h1>Data Exploration</h1>
      <h2> Preprocessing </h2>
      <p> Two databases were utilized as sources due to the need for comprehensive data coverage.
        In instances where one dataset lacked certain variables or characteristics, we would refer to the other dataset to ensure completeness.
        Furthermore, a cross-validation process was conducted, comparing and verifying the data from both sources to enhance data reliability and accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We compiled the datasets across all years into one sheet. We then sorted the data by urbanity and then by region.
        Since we will be applying regression models, we need not care for handling outliers or carrying out standardization.
        Additionally, outliers may reflect extreme wealth or poverty, which may be meaningful in understanding income inequality.
        We then computed for the average household income per area type per year.
      </p>
      <h2> Visualization </h2>
      <p> We created a line chart to visualize the difference in average household income between urban and rural areas. </p>
