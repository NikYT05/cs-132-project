        According to a 2022 report, the Philippines has one of the highest income inequality rates in East Asia, with a
        majority of lower income earners capturing only 14% of the national income and the top 1% contributing 17%.

      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
        As social inequality continues to be a pressing issue globally, the Philippines faces its own challenges in
        achieving social inclusion and reducing disparities in income distribution. In line with Sustainable Development
        Goal 10 (SDG 10), which aims to reduce inequality within and among countries, our project investigates the
        differences in income disparity between urban and rural areas in the Philippines by analyzing the Gini indices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gini index is a summary measure of income inequality within a population. It is derived from the Lorenz
        curve,
        which is a graphical representation of income or wealth distribution.
      </p>
      <h1>Objectives</h1>

        <li> To investigate the differences in income disparity between urban and rural areas in the Philippines by
          analyzing the Gini indices </li>
        <li> To investigate the trends/relationships between income inequality and economic stability </li>
