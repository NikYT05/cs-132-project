        According to a 2022 report, the Philippines has one of the highest income inequality rates in East Asia, with a
        majority of lower income earners capturing only 14% of the national income and the top 1% contributing 17%.

      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
        As social inequality continues to be a pressing issue globally, the Philippines faces its own challenges in
        achieving social inclusion and reducing disparities in income distribution. In line with Sustainable Development
        Goal 10 (SDG 10), which aims to reduce inequality within and among countries, our project investigates income
        disparity across Philippine regions by analyzing the Gini index.
      </p>
      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <h3>Objective 1</h3>
      <p>
        To investigate the differences in income disparity between urban and rural areas in the Philippines by analyzing
        the Gini indices
      </p>
      <h3>Objective 2</h3>
      <p>
        To investigate the trends/relationships between income inequality and economic stability
      </p>
      <h2>Research Questions</h2>
      <p>
        Is there a significant difference in income inequality between urban and rural areas in the Philippines?
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        Null Hypothesis <br>
        There is no significant difference in income inequality. <br>
        <br>

        Alternative Hypothesis <br>
        There is a significant difference in income inequality.
      </div>
      <p>
        Given the CPI, does it affect the income disparity between urban and rural areas.
      </p>
      <div class="callout">
        Null Hypothesis <br>
        There is no significant difference in income inequality. <br>
        <br>

        Alternative Hypothesis <br>
        There is a significant difference in income inequality.
